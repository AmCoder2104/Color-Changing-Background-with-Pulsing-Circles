HTML Structure:

Create a basic HTML structure with a <div> element that will contain the pulsing circles.
CSS Styles:

Style the body with a default background color of your choice.
Create a class for the circles that sets their size (e.g., 50px by 50px), background color (e.g., red), and border-radius to make them circular.
Create a pulsing animation using @keyframes that changes the scale of the circles to create a pulsing effect.
Use a separate class for the background color change, which will transition smoothly between colors.
JavaScript Functionality:

Use JavaScript to create a function that changes the background color of the body at regular intervals (e.g., every 2 seconds).
Create multiple circles and append them to the container, applying the pulsing animation to each circle.
Ensure that the circles are positioned in a way that they are evenly spaced out.
Use setInterval to change the background color and create an array of colors to cycle through.
Use CSS position: absolute; for the circles to position them freely on the page.
Experiment with different sizes, colors, and pulsing speeds for the circles to create a visually appealing effect.
